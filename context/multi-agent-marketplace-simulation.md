# Multi-Agent Marketplace Simulation Challenge

## Goal
Build autonomous AI agents that simulate a functioning marketplace where agents buy, sell, and interact with each other in real-time, creating emergent economic behaviors and market dynamics.

## Tasks
* Define agent roles.
* Allow tooling for transaction processing, price discovery, negotiation, and interaction logging.
* Run at least one complete market simulation with measurable outcomes.

## Requirements
* 10-20 agents with distinct personalities and trading strategies.
* Agent memory system with retrieval of past interactions and transactions.
* Complete transaction ledger tracking all sales, purchases, and interactions.
* Don't use N8N we expected it in python.

## Inspirations
* [Agent Laboratory](https://agentlaboratory.github.io/) - Framework for autonomous agent research and experimentation
* [Generative Agents](https://github.com/joonspk-research/generative_agents) - Interactive simulacra of human behavior

## Submission
* Provide code/configs, checkpoints, README, technical documentation, and experiment evidence (videos, plots, logs).
* Be creative and feel free to include other features that you want to the simulation. If you use any external reference you must cite it in your repo.
* Ensure the repository is reproducible end-to-end.
* See [Global Guidelines](https://gist.github.com/ggoncalvescw/beb0bf13967eed4b7b54c6959cc80350) for submission and evaluation standards.
* When you complete this challenge, send the **full project** to **nimbus@cloudwalk.io**.
