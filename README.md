## 🏆 Overview

This project simulates a **livestock market** (or any asset class) populated by autonomous AI agents. Unlike standard simulations, each agent possesses a unique **Persona** (e.g., "The Whale", "The Panic Seller", "The Value Investor") backed by a **Hybrid LLM Strategy**.

- **Strategic Agents** use **Llama 3 70B** (Groq) for deep reasoning.
- **Analytical Agents** use **Gemini 1.5 Flash** for long-context analysis.
- **Algorithmic Agents** use **GPT-4o Mini** for strict rule following.
- **Reactive Agents** use **Llama 3 8B** for high-speed execution.

## ✨ Key Features

1.  **Hybrid LLM Engine**: Orchestrates 4 different LLMs simultaneously to balance cost, speed, and intelligence.
2.  **Rich Terminal UI**: Real-time dashboard with Order Book, Ticker, and live "Breaking News" generated by a Journalist Agent.
3.  **Emergent Behavior**: Watch FOMO buyers spark rallies while Contrarians short the top.
4.  **Persistent Memory**: Agents remember past trades using **ChromaDB** (Vector Store) + **SQLite** (Ledger).
5.  **Data Analysis**: Built-in tools to plot price history and wealth distribution.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- `uv` (recommended) or `pip`

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/agent-market.git
    cd agent-market
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    uv sync
    # OR
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Setup Keys**
    Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your keys:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    *   `GROQ_API_KEY` (Required for most agents)
    *   `GEMINI_API_KEY` (Required for Journalist/Value agents)
    *   `OPENAI_API_KEY` (Optional, falls back if missing)

### Running the Simulation

```bash
uv run python main.py
```
*Press `Ctrl+C` to stop.*

### Analyzing Results

After a run, generate charts:
```bash
uv run python src/analysis/chart.py
```
Check the `plots/` directory for `price_history.png`.

### Running Tests

```bash
uv run pytest tests/ -v
```

**Coverage Report:**
```bash
uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html
open htmlcov/index.html
```

## 📚 Documentation

Detailed documentation is available in the `docs/` folder and project root:

-   **[System Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)**: High-level system design, data flow diagrams, and component breakdown.
-   **[Technical Docs](TECHNICAL_DOCS.md)**: Deep dive into the Hybrid LLM Strategy, Persona mappings, and Database Schema.
-   **[Deployment Guide](DEPLOYMENT.md)**: Instructions for Docker, Cloud Run, and Streamlit deployment.

## 🧠 Architecture

The system follows a **Facade-based architecture** where the central `MarketEngine` mediates all interactions between the autonomous **Agents** and the **Order Book**.

> **See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for full diagrams and details.**

### Core Loop
1.  **Sense:** Agents receive the current `MarketState` (Price, L1 Order Book).
2.  **Think:** Agents query their Vector Memory (ChromaDB) for past lessons, then send a prompt to their assigned LLM.
3.  **Act:** Agents submit a structured JSON decision (`BUY`, `SELL`, `HOLD`).
4.  **Execute:** The Market Engine matches orders and persists trades to the Ledger.

## 📦 Tech Stack
-   **Orchestration**: `python`, `uv`
-   **LLMs**: `litellm` (Unified Interface)
-   **Database**: `sqlite` (Relational), `chromadb` (Vector)
-   **UI**: `rich`
-   **Data**: `pandas`, `seaborn`
